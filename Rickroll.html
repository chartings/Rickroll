        <p class = "text">Three researchers from Michigan State University have developed a low-cost, open-source 
            fingerprint reader which can detect fake prints. They call it RaspiReader, and they’ve 
            built it using a Raspberry Pi 3 and two Camera Modules. Joshua and his colleagues have 
            just uploaded all the info you need to build your own version — let’s go!

            We’ve probably all seen a movie in which a burglar crosses a room full of laser tripwires and then enters 
            the safe full of loot by tricking the fingerprint-secured lock with a fake print. 
            Turns out, the second part is not that unrealistic: you can fake fingerprints using a range of 
            materials, such as glue or latex.
            If the spoof print layer capping the spoofer’s finger is thin enough, it can even fool readers that detect blood flow, pulse, or temperature. This is becoming a significant security risk, not least for anyone who unlocks their smartphone using a fingerprint.

            <b>The RaspiReader</b>
            This is where Anil K. Jain comes in: Professor Jain leads a biometrics research group. 
            Under his guidance, Joshua J. Engelsma and Kai Cao set out to develop a fingerprint reader 
            with improved spoof-print detection. Ultimately, they aim to help the development of more 
            secure commercial technologies. With their project, the team has also created an amazing 
            resource for anyone who wants to build their own fingerprint reader.

            So that replicating their device would be easy, they wanted to make it using inexpensive, 
            readily available components, which is why they turned to Raspberry Pi technology.
